<a name="fourdeltaone-status-project" class="anchor" href="#fourdeltaone-status-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>fourDeltaOne Status Project</h1>

<p>The most recent version of the original code of the fourDeltaOne status website.</p>

<p>Development on this code by Icedream has been dropped in March and the ownership has
been given over to MAGIC. The code is pretty much useless as of the cancelling
of fourDeltaOne due to its C&amp;D. It should be only used as a reference or as an opportunity
for bug fixing and maybe reviving the code.</p>

<p><em>Don't rely on it as in expecting it to be bug-free. It is not.</em></p>

<a name="will-i-get-support-for-this-code" class="anchor" href="#will-i-get-support-for-this-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Will I get support for this code?</h2>

<p>I expect from you as the code user to know what you're doing. Don't contact me if you don't
know how to properly set up a virtual host on Apache or compile C# stuff or similar, that will
just tell me that you're not okay to maintain this project properly. Instead look it up on
Google and <em>educate yourself</em>. Only if that fails, and only then, you can give it a try on IRC.
But no guarantees.</p>

<p>tl;dr: <em>No</em>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="what-does-this-repository-include" class="anchor" href="#what-does-this-repository-include"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does this repository include?</h2>

<p>Right at the moment, this repository includes the source code from the following
parts of the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Status backend (API, <code>backend/</code> folder)<br>
</li>
<li>Status frontend (Webpage, <code>webpage/</code> folder)</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="i-want-to-have-this-on-my-own-server" class="anchor" href="#i-want-to-have-this-on-my-own-server"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I want to have this on my own server!</h2>

<ol>
<li>It's the least important problem, but you will need to compile the latest
Mono (or at least 2.11 or 3.x) to get the backend running since it uses
.NET 4.5. If the server is a Windows server, just install the latest
.NET Framework, you won't need Mono. You need also the rewrite module for Apache.</li>
<li>You will need the complete source code tree of fourdeltaone-status. This
means you have to check out all the submodules too. This is done by using
<code>git submodule update --init</code> or whatever you prefer.</li>
<li>Compile the backend with the <code>build.bat</code> for Windows or the
<code>build.sh</code> for Linux. At this point, all requirements are expected
to be installed.</li>
<li>Check <code>backend/bin/Release</code> and edit the configuration to your needs.
Especially the authentication part is important. Make sure you add port forwarding
to the port 29001 on every firewall which may block connections.
<em>Note:</em> If you are going to run the backend on a different port than 29001 or
even on a different server than the website (or you generally changed important API
source bits), you need to create a <code>website/config.json</code>. How to do that is explained under "Customizing the
frontend".</li>
<li>Run the backend binary (fdocheck.exe), on Linux in some <code>screen</code> session or
whatever you prefer to run background tasks. You can even do
<code>mono fdocheck.exe &amp;disown</code>.</li>
<li>Configure your apache with a virtualhost pointing to the <code>website/</code>
directory.</li>
<li>Test the website. It should work now.</li>
</ol><h2>
<a name="customizing-the-frontend" class="anchor" href="#customizing-the-frontend"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Customizing the frontend</h2>

<p>The website code is customizable without changes in the code itself. It saves you a lot
of time in case you want to have backend and frontend on different servers or if you can't
use port 29001 (or generally changed the source code).
For this you need to make a JSON file <code>config.json</code> in the <code>website/</code>
folder.</p>

<p>If you don't know how a JSON file looks like, you should look it up on Google. It is easy
and short, it's only <code>{ key: value, key: value, key: { key: value, key: value } }</code>.</p>

<p>So let's look at a complete example of a configuration file:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-json"><pre><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">"backend"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">"port"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">29001</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">"host"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"s.mufff.in"</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">"path"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"/"</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">"secure"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This contains all currently available options which you can customize.
All parameters can be left out, in this case they will be set to the default.
Below the explaination:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<em>Backend</em>
The backend configuration allows you to give details about where the frontend can access the
data generated by the backend.

<ul>
<li>int <em>port</em>: This shouldn't be changed unless you edited the server API code in the backend.
Default is 29001.</li>
<li>string <em>host</em>: The host on which the backend runs. IP or hostname is both okay.
Default is same host as frontend (looked up via JavaScript from the client).</li>
<li>string <em>path</em>: This shouldn't be changed unless you edited the server API code in the backend.
Default is "/".</li>
<li>boolean <em>secure</em>: This shouldn't be changed unless you edited the server API code in the backend.
Default is false.</li>
</ul>
</li>
